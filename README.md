# spam_email_detection_usuing_ML
Email Motoring was and is one of the sensitive needs for an individual as it holds a gateway to almost all  personal sensitive information. An email address is used into almost all import platform as credentials like  bank account, personal social account and others. So all the internet misusers set their eyes on it. They  usually send a link containing malicious virus which affects the browsers computers some time they set up  a key logger on a device through to get hold on to typed sensitive information. Thatâ€™s why email needs to  be observed before trusting it. Our goal is to categorize the email so that we can categorize these spams via  identifying them. We used a machine learning algorithm to create a supervised model from a labeled dataset Which detects spam emails and idea is to create a plugin which will check the new incoming emails to  detect it and to notify the users. Our model will be keep doing good because the more emails an user will  get our dataset will get enriched too. Because before reaching a certain points we will add this email data  under a label into the dataset.
